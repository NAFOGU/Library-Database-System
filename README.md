# Library Database System

This project was completed as part my coursework assessment at the University of Salford. Using T-SQL statements, I designed and implemented a comprehensive library database from scratch, which serve as a very important tool in streamlining the library's operations, ensuring the integrity of its data and ehancing the overall experienc of its users.
