# Library Database System

This project was completed as part my coursework assessment at the University of Salford. Using T-SQL statements, I designed and implemented a comprehensive library database from scratch, which serve as a very important tool in streamlining the library's operations, ensuring the integrity of its data and ehancing the overall experienc of its users.

# Main Features of the Database.

1. **T-SQL Implementation:** The project involved the use of Transact-SQL (T-SQL) statements, a specialized language for managing and querying relational databases.

2. **Streamlining Operations:** The main purpose of the database is to streamline the operations of a library and make it more efficient. This involves automating takes inputing or updating  members record, book checkouts, returns catalogue updates and tracking of fine repayments.

3. **Normalization:** The database was normalized to third normal form (3NF) to eliminate data redundancy and ensure data integrity. This was done by decomposing tables into smaller, related tables and establishing relationships between them.

4. **Triggers:** Triggers were created for the database ensure automation of some activities related to updating book returns, fine repayemnts, deletion of members' record.

5. **Stored-Procedures and Functions:** User-defined functions and procedures were also incorporated to simplify complex tasks for the users of the database.

6. **Data Integrity:** The integrity of the database was ensured by selecting appropriate data types and sizes for each fields of the table, primary keys were created to ensure the uniqueness of the table records, and foreign keys were used to extablish the relationships between the tables.

7. **Data Security:** To protect the database from breach of security, members' passwords were encrypted using salted hash.
